abstract: Path validation that enforces and verifies the path taken by network
  packets has become an important block for secure network protocols and defence
  mechanisms. Indeed, an Internet Services Provider (ISP) might decide to
  redirect your traffic through a less efficient ISP just because it is cheaper.
  That arises some security issues. This paper exposes the possible problems
  around the lack of path validation and provides a state-of-the-art of the
  existing path validation protocols.
